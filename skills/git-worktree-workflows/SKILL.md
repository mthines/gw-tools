## 1. Git Worktree Fundamentals

### What are Git Worktrees?

Git worktrees allow you to have multiple working directories attached to a single repository. Instead of switching branches in your current directory, you can check out different branches in separate directories simultaneously.

**Traditional branch switching:**

```bash
# Your current work is interrupted
git checkout feature-a     # Work on feature A
git checkout feature-b     # Switch context, lose focus
git checkout main          # Switch again for hotfix
```

**With worktrees:**

```bash
# Each branch has its own directory
/repo.git/main/           # Main branch always ready
/repo.git/feature-a/      # Feature A development
/repo.git/feature-b/      # Feature B development in parallel
/repo.git/hotfix-123/     # Hotfix without interrupting features
```

### Worktree vs Branch Switching vs Cloning

| Approach             | Pros                                               | Cons                                                  |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Branch Switching** | Single directory, less disk space                  | Interrupts work, requires stashing, IDE reindexes     |
| **Worktrees**        | Parallel work, no interruption, shared Git history | Slightly more disk space for working files            |
| **Cloning**          | Complete isolation                                 | Huge disk space, separate Git history, harder to sync |

### When Worktrees Shine

Worktrees are ideal for:

- **Parallel feature development** - Work on multiple features without context switching
- **Hotfix workflows** - Handle urgent bugs while continuing feature work
- **Code reviews** - Check out PR branches without disrupting your current work
- **Testing** - Test multiple versions or configurations simultaneously
- **Long-running experiments** - Keep experimental branches separate from main work
- **Build artifacts** - Separate build processes without conflicts

### Worktree Limitations and Gotchas

**What worktrees share:**

- ✅ Git repository (.git directory)
- ✅ Commit history and objects
- ✅ Branches and tags
- ✅ Stashes
- ✅ Hooks and config

**What worktrees DON'T share:**

- ❌ Working directory files
- ❌ Untracked files
- ❌ node_modules (unless symlinked)
- ❌ Build artifacts
- ❌ .env files (unless copied)

**Important limitations:**

- You cannot check out the same branch in multiple worktrees simultaneously
- Each worktree needs its own dependencies installed (node_modules, vendor/, etc.)
- IDE workspace settings may need adjustment for each worktree
- Some Git UI tools have limited worktree support

---

## 2. Creating and Managing Worktrees with gw

### Getting Started: Clone and Initialize

If you're setting up a new repository with gw, you can clone and initialize in one step:

```bash
# Clone a repository and automatically set up gw
$ gw init git@github.com:user/repo.git

Cloning repository from git@github.com:user/repo.git...
✓ Repository cloned to repo

Setting up gw_root branch...
✓ Created gw_root branch

Initializing gw configuration...
✓ Configuration created

Creating main worktree...
✓ Created main worktree

✓ Repository initialized successfully!
```

This automatically:
1. Clones the repository with `--no-checkout`
2. Creates a `gw_root` branch for the bare repository
3. Auto-detects the default branch (main, master, etc.)
4. Creates the gw configuration at `.gw/config.json`
5. Creates your first worktree for the default branch
6. Names the repository directory with `.git` suffix (bare repo convention)
7. Navigates you to the repository directory (with shell integration)

**Clone with configuration:**

```bash
# Clone with auto-copy files configured
$ gw init git@github.com:user/repo.git \
          --auto-copy-files .env,secrets/ \
          --post-add "pnpm install"

# Clone into a custom directory
$ gw init git@github.com:user/repo.git my-project

# Clone and configure interactively
$ gw init https://github.com/user/repo.git --interactive
```

**For existing repositories:**

If you already have a cloned repository, initialize gw from within it:

```bash
$ cd ~/projects/myapp
$ gw init

Auto-detected git root: /projects/myapp.git
✓ Configuration created successfully
```

### The `gw add` Command

The `gw add` command is an enhanced version of `git worktree add` with automatic file copying and navigation:

```bash
# Basic usage - create worktree for existing branch
# Automatically navigates to the new worktree
gw add feature-auth

# Create worktree without automatic navigation
gw add feature-auth --no-cd

# Create worktree with new branch
gw add feature-payments -b feature-payments

# Create from a different branch instead of defaultBranch
gw add feature-payment-v2 --from develop

# Create child feature branch from parent feature branch
gw add feature-auth-social --from feature-auth

# Create from specific start point
gw add hotfix-security -b hotfix-security main

# Force creation (even if branch already checked out elsewhere)
gw add feature-test --force
```

### Navigating to Existing Worktrees

If you try to add a worktree that already exists, `gw add` will prompt you to navigate to it:

```bash
$ gw add feature-auth

ℹ Worktree feature-auth already exists at:
  /projects/myapp.git/feature-auth

Navigate to it? [Y/n]:
# Press Enter to navigate (default: Yes), or 'n' to cancel
```

This is convenient when you're not sure if you've already created a worktree for a branch. Requires shell integration to be installed (`gw install-shell`).

### Auto-Copying Files

When creating worktrees with `gw add`, files configured in `.gw/config.json` are automatically copied:

```json
{
  "root": "/Users/you/projects/myapp.git",
  "defaultBranch": "main",
  "autoCopyFiles": [".env", ".env.local", "secrets/", "components/ui/.vercel/"]
}
```

**What gets copied:**

- Environment files (.env, .env.local)
- Secrets and credentials
- Local configuration
- Cache directories (if needed)

**What should NOT be auto-copied:**

- node_modules (install fresh or symlink)
- Build artifacts (build fresh)
- Large binary files
- IDE settings (.vscode/, .idea/)

Example creating a worktree with auto-copy:

```bash
$ gw add feature-new-dashboard

Creating worktree feature-new-dashboard...
✓ Branch 'feature-new-dashboard' set up to track 'origin/feature-new-dashboard'
✓ Worktree created: /projects/myapp.git/feature-new-dashboard

Copying files from main...
✓ Copied: .env
✓ Copied: .env.local
✓ Copied: secrets/api-keys.json
✓ Copied: components/ui/.vercel/

Done! Navigate with: gw cd feature-new-dashboard
```

**Note:** The branch is configured to track its own remote branch (`origin/feature-new-dashboard`), not `origin/main`. This means `git push` will push to the correct branch without needing `-u origin <branch>`.

### Manual File Copying with `gw sync`

If you need to copy files later or from a different source:

```bash
# Copy all autoCopyFiles from config (if configured)
gw sync feature-auth

# Copy specific files from main to current worktree
gw sync feature-auth .env components/agents/.env

# Copy from a different worktree
gw sync --from staging feature-auth .env
```

### Tracking vs Detached HEAD States

**Tracking branches** (recommended):

```bash
# Creates branch from origin/main, tracking its own remote branch
gw add feature-x

# Shows branch relationship
$ git status
On branch feature-x
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/feature-x'.

# Push works without specifying remote/branch
git push  # Pushes to origin/feature-x
```

**Note:** When `gw add` creates a new branch, it automatically configures upstream tracking to `origin/<branch-name>`, not to the branch it was created from. This ensures `git push` works correctly.

**Detached HEAD** (for temporary work):

```bash
# Check out specific commit
gw add temp-test --detach v1.2.3

# No branch, just a commit
$ git status
HEAD detached at v1.2.3
```

Use tracking branches for features you'll push. Use detached HEAD for temporary testing or inspecting old commits.

### Branch Creation Strategies

**Feature branches:**

```bash
# Branch from main
gw add feature-name -b feature-name main

# Branch from develop
gw add feature-name -b feature-name develop
```

**Hotfix branches:**

```bash
# Branch from production tag
gw add hotfix-security -b hotfix-security v1.2.3

# Branch from main for immediate fix
gw add hotfix-critical -b hotfix-critical main
```

**Release branches:**

```bash
# Create release candidate from develop
gw add release-v2.0 -b release-v2.0 develop
```

---

## 3. Navigating Between Worktrees

### Using `gw cd` for Quick Navigation

The `gw cd` command provides smart navigation to worktrees:

```bash
# Full worktree name
gw cd feature-authentication

# Partial match (first match wins)
gw cd feat    # Matches feature-authentication if it's first

# Smart matching by branch name
gw cd auth    # Finds worktree with 'auth' in name
```

### Using `gw checkout` (or `gw co`) for Smart Branch Checkout

The `gw checkout` command is a smart wrapper around `git checkout` that understands worktrees:

```bash
# Checkout a branch - navigates if already checked out elsewhere
gw checkout main
# or use the alias
gw co main

# If branch is checked out in another worktree:
# Output: Branch main is checked out in another worktree:
#   /projects/myapp.git/main
# Navigating there...

# If branch exists on remote but not locally, prompts to create worktree:
gw checkout feature-new
# Output: Branch feature-new exists on remote but not locally.
# Create a new worktree for it? [Y/n]:
```

**When to use `gw checkout` vs `gw cd`:**

- Use `gw checkout <branch>` when you think of branches (like `git checkout`)
- Use `gw cd <worktree>` when you think of directory names
- Both support partial matching and navigate to existing worktrees
- `gw checkout` additionally handles remote branches and provides worktree-aware error messages

**Why not just use `git checkout`?**

With worktrees, `git checkout main` will fail if main is checked out in another worktree:

```bash
$ git checkout main
fatal: 'main' is already checked out at '/projects/myapp.git/main'
```

With `gw checkout`, this just takes you there instead of showing an error. It reduces friction when transitioning from traditional Git workflows to worktree-based workflows.

### Shell Integration

After installing `gw` via npm, a shell function is automatically installed:

```bash
# This is actually a shell function, not the binary
gw cd feature-auth

# The shell function:
# 1. Calls the actual gw binary
# 2. Gets the worktree path
# 3. Changes directory in your current shell
```

**Checking if shell integration is installed:**

```bash
# Test it
gw cd main
pwd  # Should show path to main worktree

# If not working, reinstall shell integration
gw install-shell
```

**Shell integration features:**

- **Real-time streaming output** - Commands like `gw add` now stream output as it's generated (no buffering)
- **Auto-navigation** - Automatically navigate to new worktrees after `gw add` completes
- **Smart cleanup** - Auto-navigate to repo root when removing the current worktree with `gw remove`

**For development aliases:**

If you're developing gw-tools locally, you can install shell integration for a development command:

```bash
# Install for development (replace with your actual path)
gw install-shell --name gw-dev \
  --command "deno run --allow-all ~/path/to/gw-tools/packages/gw-tool/src/main.ts"

# Then use it with full integration
gw-dev add feat-branch  # Output streams in real-time!
gw-dev cd feat-branch   # Navigation works!
```

### IDE Workspace Management

**VS Code:**

Open each worktree as a separate window:

```bash
gw cd feature-a
code .
```

Or use multi-root workspaces:

```json
// myapp.code-workspace
{
  "folders": [
    {" "name": "Main",
      "path": "/projects/myapp.git/main"
    },
    {
      "name": "Feature A",
      "path": "/projects/myapp.git/feature-a"
    },
    {
      "name": "Feature B",
      "path": "/projects/myapp.git/feature-b"
    }
  ]
}
```

**JetBrains IDEs (WebStorm, IntelliJ, etc.):**

Each worktree can be its own project:

```bash
gw cd feature-a
idea .
```

Or attach multiple source roots to a single project.

## 4. Listing and Inspecting Worktrees

### The `gw list` Command

List all worktrees in your repository:

```bash
$ gw list

/projects/myapp.git/main          abc123f [main]
/projects/myapp.git/feature-auth  def456a [feature-auth]
/projects/myapp.git/hotfix-bug    ghi789b [hotfix-bug] (detached)
/projects/myapp.git/old-feature   jkl012c [feature-old] (locked)
```

### Understanding Worktree States

**Normal worktree:**

```
/projects/myapp.git/feature-auth  def456a [feature-auth]
```

- Path, commit hash, branch name

**Detached HEAD:**

```
/projects/myapp.git/temp  xyz789d (detached)
```

- No branch, pointing to specific commit

**Locked worktree:**

```
/projects/myapp.git/protected  abc123f [protected] (locked)
```

- Cannot be removed with `gw remove` unless unlocked first

**Prunable worktree:**

```
/old/path/feature  abc123f [feature] (prunable)
```

- Directory was moved or deleted, reference still exists

### Finding Worktrees by Branch Name

```bash
# List all worktrees
gw list

# Filter with grep
gw list | grep feature

# Find specific branch
gw list | grep "\[main\]"
```

### Identifying the Main Worktree

The first worktree listed is the main worktree (the original repository):

```bash
$ gw list
/projects/myapp.git/main  abc123f [main]  ← Main worktree
/projects/myapp.git/feature  def456a [feature]
```

The main worktree:

- Contains the actual `.git` directory
- Cannot be removed
- Is the parent of all other worktrees

## 5. Common Workflow Patterns

### Feature Branch Development

**Scenario:** Starting a new feature without interrupting current work

```bash
# Currently working in main
pwd  # /projects/myapp.git/main

# Create feature worktree
gw add feature-user-profiles -b feature-user-profiles

# Navigate to new worktree
gw cd feature-user-profiles

# Work on feature
npm install
npm run dev

# Meanwhile, main worktree is untouched
```

**Benefit:** Your main branch stays clean and ready for hotfixes or other work.

### Keeping Feature Branches Up to Date

**Scenario:** Updating your feature branch with latest changes from main

```bash
# Working in feature worktree
gw cd feature-user-profiles

# Update with latest changes from main (uses configured strategy)
gw update

# Or update from a different branch
gw update --from develop

# Force merge strategy (overrides config)
gw update --merge

# Force rebase strategy (overrides config)
gw update --rebase

# Preview what would happen
gw update --dry-run
```

**Why use `gw update` instead of `git pull`?**

When working in a worktree, you cannot simply checkout main to pull the latest changes because main is typically checked out in another worktree. The `gw update` command solves this by:

1. Fetching the latest version of main (or specified branch) from remote
2. Updating your current branch using either merge or rebase strategy
3. Handling conflicts and providing clear guidance

**Update strategies:**

- **Merge** (default): Creates merge commits, preserves complete history
- **Rebase**: Replays commits for linear history, cleaner but rewrites history

Configure default strategy in `.gw/config.json` or override per-command with `--merge`/`--rebase` flags.

**Safety features:**

- Blocks if you have uncommitted changes (use `--force` to override)
- Blocks if you're in a detached HEAD state
- Provides clear guidance when merge/rebase conflicts occur

**Example workflow:**

```bash
# Start working on feature
gw cd feature-dashboard

# Work for a few days...
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add dashboard widgets"

# Meanwhile, main has new changes
# Update your feature branch with latest main
gw update

# If there's a conflict, you'll get clear guidance:
# For merge conflicts:
#   1. Edit conflicted files
#   2. git add <resolved-files>
#   3. git commit
# For rebase conflicts:
#   1. Edit conflicted files
#   2. git add <resolved-files>
#   3. git rebase --continue

# Continue working
git add .
git commit -m "feat: integrate new API endpoints from main"
```

**Benefit:** Keep your feature branch up to date without switching worktrees or manually managing fetch/merge operations.

### Hotfix Workflows While Continuing Feature Work

**Scenario:** Critical bug in production while working on a feature

```bash
# Currently working on feature-dashboard
gw cd feature-dashboard
# In the middle of uncommitted changes...

# Create hotfix worktree (doesn't interrupt feature work)
gw add hotfix-login-bug -b hotfix-login-bug main

# Navigate to hotfix
gw cd hotfix-login-bug

# Fix the bug
vim src/auth/login.js
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve login timeout issue"
git push origin hotfix-login-bug

# Go back to feature work
gw cd feature-dashboard
# All your uncommitted changes are still there!
```

**Benefit:** No need to stash, commit WIP, or lose context.

### Hierarchical Feature Development

**Scenario:** Building related features where one depends on another

Sometimes you need to create a child feature branch that builds on top of a parent feature branch that hasn't been merged yet. The `--from` option makes this workflow seamless:

```bash
# Create parent feature from main
gw add feature-auth

# Work on authentication foundation
gw cd feature-auth
# ... implement basic auth ...
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add basic authentication"

# Create child feature from the auth branch (not main)
gw add feature-auth-social --from feature-auth

# Navigate to child feature
gw cd feature-auth-social

# This branch now has all the auth foundation from feature-auth
# Build social login on top of basic auth
# ... implement OAuth integration ...
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add social login with OAuth"
```

**Benefits:**
- Child feature automatically includes all parent feature commits
- Can develop related features in parallel without waiting for merges
- Tracks `origin/feature-auth-social` for push (not `origin/feature-auth`)
- Clear dependency relationship between features

**Common patterns:**
```bash
# Experimental variations of a feature
gw add feature-dashboard-v2 --from feature-dashboard

# Staged rollouts with different implementations
gw add feature-api-graphql --from feature-api
gw add feature-api-rest --from feature-api

# Environment-specific feature branches
gw add feature-payment-staging --from develop
gw add feature-payment-prod --from main
```

**When to merge:**
1. Merge parent feature first: `feature-auth` → `main`
2. Rebase or merge child onto updated main
3. Merge child feature: `feature-auth-social` → `main`

### Code Review Workflows

**Scenario:** Reviewing a teammate's PR without disrupting your work

```bash
# Create reviewer worktree
gw add review-pr-123 -b pr-123 origin/pr-123

# Navigate and review
gw cd review-pr-123
npm install
npm test
npm run dev  # Test the changes

# Run code reviews, add comments
git checkout -b pr-123-suggestions
# Make suggestions...

# Return to your work
gw cd feature-dashboard

# Clean up when done
gw remove review-pr-123
```

**Benefit:** Review code in a real environment without affecting your workspace.

### Testing Multiple Versions Simultaneously

**Scenario:** Testing a feature across Node.js 18 and Node.js 20

```bash
# Create worktrees for each test environment
gw add test-node18 -b feature-api
gw add test-node20 -b feature-api --force

# Set up Node 18 environment
gw cd test-node18
nvm use 18
npm install
npm test

# Set up Node 20 environment (in another terminal)
gw cd test-node20
nvm use 20
npm install
npm test

# Compare results
```

**Benefit:** Run tests in parallel, catch version-specific issues early.

### Long-Running Experiment Branches

**Scenario:** Trying a risky refactor without committing to it

```bash
# Create experiment worktree
gw add experiment-new-architecture -b experiment/new-arch

# Work on experiment over days/weeks
gw cd experiment-new-architecture
# Radical changes...

# Keep working on main features in other worktrees
gw cd feature-payments
# Normal work continues...

# Later: merge experiment if successful, or delete if not
gw cd experiment-new-architecture
git push origin experiment/new-arch  # Share with team

# Or abandon
gw remove experiment-new-architecture
```

**Benefit:** Experiment freely without risking main development.

## 6. Cleanup and Maintenance

### Removing Worktrees

**Safe removal:**

```bash
# Remove worktree (commits must be pushed or merged)
gw remove feature-completed

# Force removal (even with unpushed commits)
gw remove feature-abandoned --force
```

**What happens:**

- Working directory is deleted
- Worktree reference removed from Git
- Branch remains in repository (can still be checked out elsewhere)

### Cleaning Up Stale Worktrees

**Remove safe worktrees:**

```bash
# Preview all safe worktrees (default behavior)
gw clean --dry-run

# Remove all safe worktrees regardless of age
gw clean

# Only remove worktrees older than configured threshold
gw clean --use-autoclean-threshold

# Preview old worktrees with threshold check
gw clean --use-autoclean-threshold --dry-run

# Force removal (skips safety checks - dangerous!)
gw clean --force
```

**How it works:**

- **Default mode:** Finds ALL safe worktrees (no age check)
- **With `--use-autoclean-threshold`:** Only finds worktrees older than configured threshold (default: 7 days)
- By default, only removes worktrees with:
  - NO uncommitted changes
  - NO unpushed commits
- Always prompts for confirmation before deletion
- Never removes bare/main repository worktrees

**Cleanup strategies:**

| Command | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|
| `gw clean` | Clean up all finished work regardless of age |
| `gw clean --use-autoclean-threshold` | Regular maintenance (only old worktrees) |
| `gw prune --clean` | Aggressive cleanup with default branch protection |

**Configure the threshold:**

```bash
# Set to 14 days during initialization
gw init --clean-threshold 14

# Or manually edit .gw/config.json
{
  "cleanThreshold": 14
}
```

**Example workflow (default mode):**

```bash
# Check what would be cleaned (all safe worktrees)
$ gw clean --dry-run
INFO: Checking for safe worktrees to clean...

Worktrees to remove:
  ✗ completed-feature-1 (2 days old)
  ✗ completed-feature-2 (14 days old)

Skipped worktrees:
  ⚠ active-feature - has uncommitted changes

# Review and clean
$ gw clean
Remove 2 worktree(s)?
Type 'yes' to confirm: yes

Removing completed-feature-1...
  ✓ Removed

Removing completed-feature-2...
  ✓ Removed

SUCCESS: Removed 2 worktree(s)
```

**Example workflow (threshold mode):**

```bash
# Check what would be cleaned (only old worktrees)
$ gw clean --use-autoclean-threshold --dry-run
INFO: Checking for worktrees older than 7 days...

Worktrees to remove:
  ✗ old-feature-1 (14 days old)
  ✗ old-feature-2 (10 days old)

Skipped worktrees:
  ⚠ recent-feature - has uncommitted changes

# Review and clean
$ gw clean --use-autoclean-threshold
Remove 2 worktree(s)?
Type 'yes' to confirm: yes

SUCCESS: Removed 2 worktree(s)
```

### Cleanup Strategies: `gw clean` vs `gw prune --clean`

The gw tool provides two complementary cleanup commands for different scenarios:

**Age-based Cleanup: `gw clean`**

- Removes worktrees **older than configured threshold** (default: 7 days)
- Good for regular maintenance
- Respects safety checks (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits)
- Configurable via `.gw/config.json`

```bash
# Regular maintenance (weekly)
gw clean --dry-run  # Preview
gw clean            # Remove old worktrees
```

**Complete Cleanup: `gw prune --clean`**

- Removes **ALL clean worktrees** (regardless of age)
- First runs `git worktree prune` to clean up administrative data
- Protects default branch and current worktree
- Good for aggressive cleanup before archiving or when disk space is critical

```bash
# Aggressive cleanup (before vacation, archiving)
gw prune --clean --dry-run  # Preview
gw prune --clean            # Remove all clean worktrees
```

**Comparison:**
| Feature | `gw clean` | `gw prune --clean` |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| Age-based | Yes (configurable) | No (removes all clean) |
| Safety checks | Yes | Yes |
| Protects default branch | No | Yes |
| Runs `git worktree prune` | No | Yes |
| Use case | Regular maintenance | Aggressive cleanup |

**When to use which:**

Use `gw clean`:

- Weekly/monthly maintenance to remove stale worktrees
- When you want to keep recent worktrees but clean up old ones
- As part of automated cleanup routines

Use `gw prune --clean`:

- Before archiving a project or taking a break
- When you need to free up disk space quickly
- To reset to a minimal worktree setup (just main branch + current work)
- After completing a major milestone or release

**Example workflow:**

```bash
# Regular maintenance (weekly)
gw clean --dry-run  # Preview old worktrees
gw clean            # Remove if ok

# Major cleanup (quarterly or before breaks)
gw prune --clean --dry-run  # Preview all clean worktrees
gw prune --clean            # Remove all clean worktrees
```

### Pruning Stale Worktree References

**Scenario:** You manually deleted a worktree directory

```bash
# This shows stale references
$ gw list
/projects/myapp.git/main      abc123f [main]
/projects/myapp.git/deleted   def456a [feature] (prunable)

# Clean up stale references
gw prune

# Confirm
$ gw list
/projects/myapp.git/main  abc123f [main]
```

### Locking/Unlocking Worktrees

**Protect a worktree from accidental removal:**

```bash
# Lock production deployment worktree
gw lock production-deploy

# Try to remove (fails)
$ gw remove production-deploy
fatal: 'production-deploy' is locked; use 'git worktree unlock' to remove

# Unlock when ready
gw unlock production-deploy
gw remove production-deploy
```

### Disk Space Management Strategies

**Check worktree sizes:**

```bash
du -sh /projects/myapp.git/*
# 150M main
# 145M feature-auth
# 892M feature-payments  # Lots of node_modules!
```

**Optimization strategies:**

1. **Share node_modules with symlinks** (advanced, use with caution):

```bash
# In feature worktree
rm -rf node_modules
ln -s ../main/node_modules node_modules
```

2. **Use pnpm** (shares packages automatically):

```bash
pnpm install  # Shares packages across worktrees
```

3. **Remove old worktrees regularly**:

```bash
# List and remove old feature worktrees
gw list | grep feature-old
gw remove feature-old-1 feature-old-2
```

4. **Archive instead of keeping:**

```bash
# Push branch, remove worktree
git push origin feature-complete
gw remove feature-complete
# Can recreate later if needed
```

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Worktree already exists" Errors

**Problem:**

```bash
$ gw add feature-auth
fatal: 'feature-auth' already exists
```

**Solution:**

```bash
# List existing worktrees
gw list

# Remove old worktree first
gw remove feature-auth

# Or use a different name
gw add feature-auth-v2
```

### Git Ref Conflicts (Branch Name Hierarchy)

**Problem:**

```bash
$ gw add test
Cannot create branch test because it conflicts with existing branch test/foo

Git doesn't allow both refs/heads/test and refs/heads/test/foo
```

Git prevents creating branches with hierarchical naming conflicts (e.g., both `test` and `test/foo`) because they would require the same path to be both a file and a directory in `.git/refs/heads/`.

**Solution:**

```bash
# Option 1: Use a different name
gw add test-new -b test-new

# Option 2: Delete the conflicting branch
git branch -d test/foo
gw add test

# Option 3: Use the existing conflicting branch
gw add test/foo
```

**Prevention:** Use consistent naming conventions. Good: `feature/auth`, `feature/checkout`. Bad: mixing `feature` and `feature/new`.

### Locked Worktree Recovery

**Problem:**

```bash
$ gw remove feature-x
fatal: 'feature-x' is locked
```

**Solution:**

```bash
# Unlock the worktree
gw unlock feature-x

# Now remove
gw remove feature-x
```

### Corrupted Worktree State

**Problem:**

```bash
$ gw cd feature-x
fatal: 'feature-x' does not appear to be a git repository
```

**Solution:**

```bash
# Repair worktree administrative files
gw repair

# If that doesn't work, remove and recreate
gw remove feature-x --force
gw add feature-x -b feature-x origin/feature-x
```

### Permission Issues

**Problem:**

```bash
$ gw add feature-y
fatal: could not create work tree dir 'feature-y': Permission denied
```

**Solution:**

```bash
# Check parent directory permissions
ls -la /projects/myapp.git/

# Fix permissions
chmod 755 /projects/myapp.git/

# Or use sudo (not recommended)
sudo gw add feature-y
```

### Git Administrative File Repair

**Problem:**

```bash
$ git status
error: bad signature 0x00000000
fatal: index file corrupt
```

**Solution:**

```bash
# In affected worktree
rm .git/index
git reset

# Or use repair command
gw repair

# Rebuild index
git add .
```

### Branch Checkout Conflicts

**Problem:**

```bash
$ gw add feature-x
fatal: 'feature-x' is already checked out at '/projects/myapp.git/other-worktree'
```

**Solution:**

```bash
# Option 1: Use the existing worktree
gw cd feature-x  # Goes to /projects/myapp.git/other-worktree

# Option 2: Create new branch
gw add feature-x-new -b feature-x-new feature-x

# Option 3: Force checkout (only if you know what you're doing)
gw add feature-x-copy -b feature-x-copy --force
```

### Shell Integration Issues

**Problem:** `gw cd` doesn't navigate or shows parse errors

```bash
# Zsh example error:
/Users/name/.gw/shell/integration-gw-dev.zsh:2: defining function based on alias `gw-dev'
/Users/name/.gw/shell/integration-gw-dev.zsh:2: parse error near `()'
```

**Solution:**

```bash
# For regular gw installation
gw install-shell

# For development aliases, remove any existing alias first
# Then install with --command flag
gw install-shell --name gw-dev \
  --command "deno run --allow-all ~/path/to/gw-tools/packages/gw-tool/src/main.ts"

# Reload your shell
source ~/.zshrc  # or ~/.bashrc
```

**Common causes:**

- Conflicting alias and function with same name (remove alias from .zshrc)
- Old integration script format (reinstall fixes this)
- Shell not supported (only zsh, bash, fish)

### Cleaning Up After Errors

**Problem:** Failed worktree creation left partial state

**Solution:**

```bash
# Remove partial worktree
rm -rf /projects/myapp.git/failed-worktree

# Clean up Git references
gw prune

# Verify clean state
gw list
```
