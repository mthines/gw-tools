## 1. Git Worktree Fundamentals

### What are Git Worktrees?

Git worktrees allow you to have multiple working directories attached to a single repository. Instead of switching branches in your current directory, you can check out different branches in separate directories simultaneously.

**Traditional branch switching:**
```bash
# Your current work is interrupted
git checkout feature-a     # Work on feature A
git checkout feature-b     # Switch context, lose focus
git checkout main          # Switch again for hotfix
```

**With worktrees:**
```bash
# Each branch has its own directory
/repo.git/main/           # Main branch always ready
/repo.git/feature-a/      # Feature A development
/repo.git/feature-b/      # Feature B development in parallel
/repo.git/hotfix-123/     # Hotfix without interrupting features
```

### Worktree vs Branch Switching vs Cloning

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Branch Switching** | Single directory, less disk space | Interrupts work, requires stashing, IDE reindexes |
| **Worktrees** | Parallel work, no interruption, shared Git history | Slightly more disk space for working files |
| **Cloning** | Complete isolation | Huge disk space, separate Git history, harder to sync |

### When Worktrees Shine

Worktrees are ideal for:

- **Parallel feature development** - Work on multiple features without context switching
- **Hotfix workflows** - Handle urgent bugs while continuing feature work
- **Code reviews** - Check out PR branches without disrupting your current work
- **Testing** - Test multiple versions or configurations simultaneously
- **Long-running experiments** - Keep experimental branches separate from main work
- **Build artifacts** - Separate build processes without conflicts

### Worktree Limitations and Gotchas

**What worktrees share:**
- ✅ Git repository (.git directory)
- ✅ Commit history and objects
- ✅ Branches and tags
- ✅ Stashes
- ✅ Hooks and config

**What worktrees DON'T share:**
- ❌ Working directory files
- ❌ Untracked files
- ❌ node_modules (unless symlinked)
- ❌ Build artifacts
- ❌ .env files (unless copied)

**Important limitations:**
- You cannot check out the same branch in multiple worktrees simultaneously
- Each worktree needs its own dependencies installed (node_modules, vendor/, etc.)
- IDE workspace settings may need adjustment for each worktree
- Some Git UI tools have limited worktree support

---

## 2. Creating and Managing Worktrees with gw

### The `gw add` Command

The `gw add` command is an enhanced version of `git worktree add` with automatic file copying:

```bash
# Basic usage - create worktree for existing branch
gw add feature-auth

# Create worktree with new branch
gw add feature-payments -b feature-payments

# Create from specific start point
gw add hotfix-security -b hotfix-security main

# Force creation (even if branch already checked out elsewhere)
gw add feature-test --force
```

### Auto-Copying Files

When creating worktrees with `gw add`, files configured in `.gw/config.json` are automatically copied:

```json
{
  "root": "/Users/you/projects/myapp.git",
  "defaultBranch": "main",
  "autoCopyFiles": [
    ".env",
    ".env.local",
    "secrets/",
    "components/ui/.vercel/"
  ]
}
```

**What gets copied:**
- Environment files (.env, .env.local)
- Secrets and credentials
- Local configuration
- Cache directories (if needed)

**What should NOT be auto-copied:**
- node_modules (install fresh or symlink)
- Build artifacts (build fresh)
- Large binary files
- IDE settings (.vscode/, .idea/)

Example creating a worktree with auto-copy:

```bash
$ gw add feature-new-dashboard

Creating worktree feature-new-dashboard...
✓ Branch 'feature-new-dashboard' set up to track 'origin/main'
✓ Worktree created: /projects/myapp.git/feature-new-dashboard

Copying files from main...
✓ Copied: .env
✓ Copied: .env.local
✓ Copied: secrets/api-keys.json
✓ Copied: components/ui/.vercel/

Done! Navigate with: gw cd feature-new-dashboard
```

### Manual File Copying with `gw sync`

If you need to copy files later or from a different source:

```bash
# Copy all autoCopyFiles from config (if configured)
gw sync feature-auth

# Copy specific files from main to current worktree
gw sync feature-auth .env components/agents/.env

# Copy from a different worktree
gw sync --from staging feature-auth .env
```

### Tracking vs Detached HEAD States

**Tracking branches** (recommended):
```bash
# Creates branch that tracks remote
gw add feature-x -b feature-x origin/main

# Shows branch relationship
$ git status
On branch feature-x
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
```

**Detached HEAD** (for temporary work):
```bash
# Check out specific commit
gw add temp-test --detach v1.2.3

# No branch, just a commit
$ git status
HEAD detached at v1.2.3
```

Use tracking branches for features you'll push. Use detached HEAD for temporary testing or inspecting old commits.

### Branch Creation Strategies

**Feature branches:**
```bash
# Branch from main
gw add feature-name -b feature-name main

# Branch from develop
gw add feature-name -b feature-name develop
```

**Hotfix branches:**
```bash
# Branch from production tag
gw add hotfix-security -b hotfix-security v1.2.3

# Branch from main for immediate fix
gw add hotfix-critical -b hotfix-critical main
```

**Release branches:**
```bash
# Create release candidate from develop
gw add release-v2.0 -b release-v2.0 develop
```

## 3. Navigating Between Worktrees

### Using `gw cd` for Quick Navigation

The `gw cd` command provides smart navigation to worktrees:

```bash
# Full worktree name
gw cd feature-authentication

# Partial match (first match wins)
gw cd feat    # Matches feature-authentication if it's first

# Smart matching by branch name
gw cd auth    # Finds worktree with 'auth' in name
```

### Shell Integration

After installing `gw` via npm, a shell function is automatically installed:

```bash
# This is actually a shell function, not the binary
gw cd feature-auth

# The shell function:
# 1. Calls the actual gw binary
# 2. Gets the worktree path
# 3. Changes directory in your current shell
```

**Checking if shell integration is installed:**

```bash
# Test it
gw cd main
pwd  # Should show path to main worktree

# If not working, reinstall shell integration
gw install-shell
```

### IDE Workspace Management

**VS Code:**

Open each worktree as a separate window:

```bash
gw cd feature-a
code .
```

Or use multi-root workspaces:

```json
// myapp.code-workspace
{
  "folders": [
    {" "name": "Main",
      "path": "/projects/myapp.git/main"
    },
    {
      "name": "Feature A",
      "path": "/projects/myapp.git/feature-a"
    },
    {
      "name": "Feature B",
      "path": "/projects/myapp.git/feature-b"
    }
  ]
}
```

**JetBrains IDEs (WebStorm, IntelliJ, etc.):**

Each worktree can be its own project:

```bash
gw cd feature-a
idea .
```

Or attach multiple source roots to a single project.

## 4. Listing and Inspecting Worktrees

### The `gw list` Command

List all worktrees in your repository:

```bash
$ gw list

/projects/myapp.git/main          abc123f [main]
/projects/myapp.git/feature-auth  def456a [feature-auth]
/projects/myapp.git/hotfix-bug    ghi789b [hotfix-bug] (detached)
/projects/myapp.git/old-feature   jkl012c [feature-old] (locked)
```

### Understanding Worktree States

**Normal worktree:**
```
/projects/myapp.git/feature-auth  def456a [feature-auth]
```
- Path, commit hash, branch name

**Detached HEAD:**
```
/projects/myapp.git/temp  xyz789d (detached)
```
- No branch, pointing to specific commit

**Locked worktree:**
```
/projects/myapp.git/protected  abc123f [protected] (locked)
```
- Cannot be removed with `gw remove` unless unlocked first

**Prunable worktree:**
```
/old/path/feature  abc123f [feature] (prunable)
```
- Directory was moved or deleted, reference still exists

### Finding Worktrees by Branch Name

```bash
# List all worktrees
gw list

# Filter with grep
gw list | grep feature

# Find specific branch
gw list | grep "\[main\]"
```

### Identifying the Main Worktree

The first worktree listed is the main worktree (the original repository):

```bash
$ gw list
/projects/myapp.git/main  abc123f [main]  ← Main worktree
/projects/myapp.git/feature  def456a [feature]
```

The main worktree:
- Contains the actual `.git` directory
- Cannot be removed
- Is the parent of all other worktrees

## 5. Common Workflow Patterns

### Feature Branch Development

**Scenario:** Starting a new feature without interrupting current work

```bash
# Currently working in main
pwd  # /projects/myapp.git/main

# Create feature worktree
gw add feature-user-profiles -b feature-user-profiles

# Navigate to new worktree
gw cd feature-user-profiles

# Work on feature
npm install
npm run dev

# Meanwhile, main worktree is untouched
```

**Benefit:** Your main branch stays clean and ready for hotfixes or other work.

### Hotfix Workflows While Continuing Feature Work

**Scenario:** Critical bug in production while working on a feature

```bash
# Currently working on feature-dashboard
gw cd feature-dashboard
# In the middle of uncommitted changes...

# Create hotfix worktree (doesn't interrupt feature work)
gw add hotfix-login-bug -b hotfix-login-bug main

# Navigate to hotfix
gw cd hotfix-login-bug

# Fix the bug
vim src/auth/login.js
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve login timeout issue"
git push origin hotfix-login-bug

# Go back to feature work
gw cd feature-dashboard
# All your uncommitted changes are still there!
```

**Benefit:** No need to stash, commit WIP, or lose context.

### Code Review Workflows

**Scenario:** Reviewing a teammate's PR without disrupting your work

```bash
# Create reviewer worktree
gw add review-pr-123 -b pr-123 origin/pr-123

# Navigate and review
gw cd review-pr-123
npm install
npm test
npm run dev  # Test the changes

# Run code reviews, add comments
git checkout -b pr-123-suggestions
# Make suggestions...

# Return to your work
gw cd feature-dashboard

# Clean up when done
gw remove review-pr-123
```

**Benefit:** Review code in a real environment without affecting your workspace.

### Testing Multiple Versions Simultaneously

**Scenario:** Testing a feature across Node.js 18 and Node.js 20

```bash
# Create worktrees for each test environment
gw add test-node18 -b feature-api
gw add test-node20 -b feature-api --force

# Set up Node 18 environment
gw cd test-node18
nvm use 18
npm install
npm test

# Set up Node 20 environment (in another terminal)
gw cd test-node20
nvm use 20
npm install
npm test

# Compare results
```

**Benefit:** Run tests in parallel, catch version-specific issues early.

### Long-Running Experiment Branches

**Scenario:** Trying a risky refactor without committing to it

```bash
# Create experiment worktree
gw add experiment-new-architecture -b experiment/new-arch

# Work on experiment over days/weeks
gw cd experiment-new-architecture
# Radical changes...

# Keep working on main features in other worktrees
gw cd feature-payments
# Normal work continues...

# Later: merge experiment if successful, or delete if not
gw cd experiment-new-architecture
git push origin experiment/new-arch  # Share with team

# Or abandon
gw remove experiment-new-architecture
```

**Benefit:** Experiment freely without risking main development.

## 6. Cleanup and Maintenance

### Removing Worktrees

**Safe removal:**

```bash
# Remove worktree (commits must be pushed or merged)
gw remove feature-completed

# Force removal (even with unpushed commits)
gw remove feature-abandoned --force
```

**What happens:**
- Working directory is deleted
- Worktree reference removed from Git
- Branch remains in repository (can still be checked out elsewhere)

### Pruning Stale Worktree References

**Scenario:** You manually deleted a worktree directory

```bash
# This shows stale references
$ gw list
/projects/myapp.git/main      abc123f [main]
/projects/myapp.git/deleted   def456a [feature] (prunable)

# Clean up stale references
gw prune

# Confirm
$ gw list
/projects/myapp.git/main  abc123f [main]
```

### Locking/Unlocking Worktrees

**Protect a worktree from accidental removal:**

```bash
# Lock production deployment worktree
gw lock production-deploy

# Try to remove (fails)
$ gw remove production-deploy
fatal: 'production-deploy' is locked; use 'git worktree unlock' to remove

# Unlock when ready
gw unlock production-deploy
gw remove production-deploy
```

### Disk Space Management Strategies

**Check worktree sizes:**

```bash
du -sh /projects/myapp.git/*
# 150M main
# 145M feature-auth
# 892M feature-payments  # Lots of node_modules!
```

**Optimization strategies:**

1. **Share node_modules with symlinks** (advanced, use with caution):
```bash
# In feature worktree
rm -rf node_modules
ln -s ../main/node_modules node_modules
```

2. **Use pnpm** (shares packages automatically):
```bash
pnpm install  # Shares packages across worktrees
```

3. **Remove old worktrees regularly**:
```bash
# List and remove old feature worktrees
gw list | grep feature-old
gw remove feature-old-1 feature-old-2
```

4. **Archive instead of keeping:**
```bash
# Push branch, remove worktree
git push origin feature-complete
gw remove feature-complete
# Can recreate later if needed
```

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Worktree already exists" Errors

**Problem:**

```bash
$ gw add feature-auth
fatal: 'feature-auth' already exists
```

**Solution:**

```bash
# List existing worktrees
gw list

# Remove old worktree first
gw remove feature-auth

# Or use a different name
gw add feature-auth-v2
```

### Locked Worktree Recovery

**Problem:**

```bash
$ gw remove feature-x
fatal: 'feature-x' is locked
```

**Solution:**

```bash
# Unlock the worktree
gw unlock feature-x

# Now remove
gw remove feature-x
```

### Corrupted Worktree State

**Problem:**

```bash
$ gw cd feature-x
fatal: 'feature-x' does not appear to be a git repository
```

**Solution:**

```bash
# Repair worktree administrative files
gw repair

# If that doesn't work, remove and recreate
gw remove feature-x --force
gw add feature-x -b feature-x origin/feature-x
```

### Permission Issues

**Problem:**

```bash
$ gw add feature-y
fatal: could not create work tree dir 'feature-y': Permission denied
```

**Solution:**

```bash
# Check parent directory permissions
ls -la /projects/myapp.git/

# Fix permissions
chmod 755 /projects/myapp.git/

# Or use sudo (not recommended)
sudo gw add feature-y
```

### Git Administrative File Repair

**Problem:**

```bash
$ git status
error: bad signature 0x00000000
fatal: index file corrupt
```

**Solution:**

```bash
# In affected worktree
rm .git/index
git reset

# Or use repair command
gw repair

# Rebuild index
git add .
```

### Branch Checkout Conflicts

**Problem:**

```bash
$ gw add feature-x
fatal: 'feature-x' is already checked out at '/projects/myapp.git/other-worktree'
```

**Solution:**

```bash
# Option 1: Use the existing worktree
gw cd feature-x  # Goes to /projects/myapp.git/other-worktree

# Option 2: Create new branch
gw add feature-x-new -b feature-x-new feature-x

# Option 3: Force checkout (only if you know what you're doing)
gw add feature-x-copy -b feature-x-copy --force
```

### Cleaning Up After Errors

**Problem:** Failed worktree creation left partial state

**Solution:**

```bash
# Remove partial worktree
rm -rf /projects/myapp.git/failed-worktree

# Clean up Git references
gw prune

# Verify clean state
gw list
```
