# Autonomous Workflow Agent Routing

When the user asks to implement something using phrases that signal independent, isolated work — such as:

- "independently", "autonomously", "in isolation", "alone", "on your own"
- "end-to-end", "full implementation", "implement X with tests and PR"
- "work on this in a worktree", "do this in parallel"
- "take care of this", "handle this without me"

Automatically use the Agent tool with `agent: "autonomous-workflow"` to handle the task. Pass the user's full request as the prompt.

Do NOT auto-trigger for:

- Simple questions, explanations, or code reviews
- Single-file edits or quick fixes (< 3 files)
- Interactive/collaborative coding where the user is actively guiding
- Exploratory research or investigation
- Tasks where the user explicitly says "here" or "in this session"

The user has opted into this behavior by installing this rule. If unsure whether the task qualifies, prefer triggering — the agent's Phase 0 validation will ask clarifying questions before doing any work.
