## 1. Workflow Overview

### What This Skill Does

This skill enables **autonomous execution** of complete feature development workflows:

1. **Validates requirements** through upfront questions
2. **Plans implementation** based on deep codebase analysis
3. **Creates isolated environment** using `gw add`
4. **Implements features** following existing patterns
5. **Tests iteratively** until all tests pass
6. **Documents changes** in relevant files
7. **Delivers draft PR** ready for human review

### When to Use This Skill

**Use this skill when:**
- User requests autonomous feature implementation
- Task has clear deliverable (feature, fix, refactor)
- Project uses gw-tools for worktree management
- Tests are available to validate correctness

**Do NOT use this skill when:**
- User wants to code alongside you (use interactive mode)
- Task is exploratory research without clear deliverable
- Project doesn't use Git or worktrees
- Changes affect critical production code without tests

### Expected Outcomes

**Successful execution produces:**
- ✅ Isolated worktree with complete implementation
- ✅ All tests passing (existing + new if applicable)
- ✅ Documentation updated (README, CHANGELOG, API docs)
- ✅ Draft PR with comprehensive description
- ✅ Clean commit history with conventional commits

**If unable to complete:**
- ⚠️ Partial implementation committed with notes
- ⚠️ Clear explanation of blockers encountered
- ⚠️ Recommendations for next steps

### Autonomy Model

This workflow operates with **high autonomy after validation**:

1. **Phase 0 (Validation)**: Interactive - ask clarifying questions
2. **Phase 1-6**: Autonomous - execute with continuous self-validation
3. **Decision points**: Use decision framework, iterate until correct
4. **Blockers**: Report and deliver partial work with notes

---

## 2. Phase 0: Validation & Questions (MANDATORY)

### 🔴 CRITICAL: ALWAYS START HERE

**This phase is MANDATORY.** Never skip directly to implementation.

### Objectives

1. **Understand requirements completely** - No assumptions
2. **Identify ambiguities** - Surface edge cases early
3. **Validate scope** - Confirm what's in/out of scope
4. **Clarify acceptance criteria** - Define "done"
5. **Get explicit confirmation** - User approves understanding

### Procedure

```markdown
## Step 1: Parse User Request

Read the user's request carefully. Identify:
- Primary feature/fix being requested
- Mentioned technologies, files, or patterns
- Implied requirements (what's assumed but not stated)
- Missing information (what's unclear)

## Step 2: Analyze Codebase Context

Before asking questions, understand the project:
- Project structure (monorepo? single app?)
- Technology stack (framework, language, tools)
- Testing setup (unit, integration, e2e?)
- Documentation patterns (where docs live)
- Existing similar features (patterns to follow)

Use tools: nx_workspace, nx_project_details, Read, Glob, Grep

## Step 3: Formulate Clarifying Questions

Ask about:

**Requirements clarity:**
- "Should X feature also handle Y scenario?"
- "What should happen when Z edge case occurs?"

**Scope boundaries:**
- "Should this include tests/docs/migrations?"
- "Are we updating existing feature or adding new?"

**Technical decisions:**
- "Prefer approach A (simpler) or B (more flexible)?"
- "Follow pattern X from file.ts or pattern Y from other.ts?"

**Acceptance criteria:**
- "How will we know this is complete?"
- "What tests should pass?"

## Step 4: Present Understanding for Validation

Summarize your understanding:

"Based on your request, I understand:
1. Goal: [primary objective]
2. Scope: [what's included/excluded]
3. Approach: [technical approach]
4. Tests: [validation strategy]
5. Docs: [documentation updates]

Questions before proceeding:
- [Question 1]
- [Question 2]
- [Question 3]

Does this match your intent?"

## Step 5: Get Explicit Confirmation

Wait for user response. Do NOT proceed until:
- ✅ All questions answered
- ✅ Understanding validated
- ✅ Scope confirmed
- ✅ User explicitly says "proceed" or equivalent

If user clarifies/corrects:
- Update your understanding
- Re-validate if significant changes
- Confirm again before proceeding
```

### Example: Validation in Action

```markdown
User: "Add dark mode toggle to the app"

Agent (Phase 0):
"Let me understand this requirement before implementation.

Current analysis:
- Project: Next.js app with Tailwind CSS
- Existing: Light theme only
- Location: No theme infrastructure found

Clarifying questions:

1. **Scope**: Should dark mode apply globally or per-page?
2. **Persistence**: Save user preference (localStorage/cookie)?
3. **Default**: System preference or manual toggle?
4. **Components**: All pages or specific sections?
5. **Approach**: Prefer Tailwind dark: classes or CSS variables?
6. **Toggle UI**: Where should the toggle appear (navbar/settings)?

My proposed approach:
- Add theme context provider
- Use Tailwind dark: classes
- Save preference to localStorage
- System preference as default
- Toggle in navbar

Does this match your vision? Any preferences on the questions above?"

[Wait for user confirmation before proceeding to Phase 1]
```

### Validation Checklist

Before leaving Phase 0:

- [ ] User request fully understood
- [ ] All ambiguities clarified
- [ ] Scope explicitly confirmed
- [ ] Acceptance criteria defined
- [ ] Technical approach validated
- [ ] User gave explicit "proceed" signal

**If any checkbox is unchecked, DO NOT proceed to Phase 1.**

## 3. Phase 1: Task Intake & Planning

### Objectives

1. **Deep codebase analysis** - Understand existing patterns thoroughly
2. **Implementation strategy** - Plan detailed approach
3. **File identification** - Know exactly what to change
4. **Self-validation** - Review plan against requirements

### Procedure

```markdown
## Step 1: Analyze Codebase (Deep Dive)

### Project Structure
- Identify relevant directories/modules
- Map dependencies between components
- Locate configuration files

Tools: nx_workspace, nx_project_details, Glob

### Existing Patterns
- Find similar features already implemented
- Study code style, naming conventions
- Understand error handling patterns
- Review testing patterns

Tools: Grep (search for patterns), Read (study implementations)

### Technology Stack
- Framework version and features
- Build tools and configuration
- Testing framework and conventions
- Documentation format

### Dependencies
- Required packages already installed?
- Need to add new dependencies?
- Version compatibility considerations

## Step 2: Create Implementation Plan

Document your plan:

**Changes Required:**
1. File: `path/to/file1.ts`
   - Add: [specific additions]
   - Modify: [specific changes]
   - Reason: [why this change]

2. File: `path/to/file2.ts`
   - Add: [specific additions]
   - Reason: [why this change]

3. New file: `path/to/file3.ts`
   - Purpose: [what this does]
   - Exports: [public API]

**Testing Strategy:**
- Unit tests: [what to test]
- Integration tests: [if applicable]
- Manual validation: [if applicable]

**Documentation Updates:**
- README.md: [what to add/change]
- API docs: [if applicable]
- CHANGELOG: [entry to add]

**Risks & Mitigations:**
- Risk: [potential issue]
  Mitigation: [how to handle]

## Step 3: Self-Validation (Review Your Plan)

Ask yourself:

**Completeness:**
- Does this plan achieve all requirements from Phase 0?
- Are edge cases from user questions addressed?
- Is anything missing?

**Correctness:**
- Does this follow existing project patterns?
- Are dependencies and imports correct?
- Will this integrate cleanly?

**Testability:**
- Can this be validated with tests?
- Are test cases comprehensive?

**Maintainability:**
- Is this approach simple enough?
- Does it follow project conventions?
- Will other developers understand this?

## Step 4: Iteration Checkpoint

If self-validation reveals issues:
1. Refine the plan
2. Re-validate
3. Iterate until plan is solid

**Do NOT proceed to Phase 2 until plan is validated.**

## Step 5: Present Plan Summary (Optional)

For complex tasks, briefly summarize plan:

"Implementation plan:
- Modifying 3 files: [list]
- Adding 1 file: [list]
- Tests: [strategy]
- Docs: [updates]

Proceeding with Phase 2: Worktree setup."
```

### Planning Checklist

- [ ] Codebase deeply analyzed
- [ ] All relevant files identified
- [ ] Implementation approach defined
- [ ] Testing strategy clear
- [ ] Documentation scope identified
- [ ] Plan self-validated
- [ ] Ready to execute

---

## 4. Phase 2: Worktree Setup

### Objectives

1. **Generate appropriate branch name** - Follow conventions
2. **Create isolated worktree** - Execute `gw add`
3. **Install dependencies** - Ensure environment ready
4. **Validate setup** - Confirm everything works

### Procedure

```markdown
## Step 1: Generate Branch Name

Use decision framework (see Section 10):

**Pattern:** `<type>/<short-description>`

Types:
- `feat/` - New feature
- `fix/` - Bug fix
- `refactor/` - Code restructuring
- `docs/` - Documentation only
- `chore/` - Tooling, dependencies
- `test/` - Adding/fixing tests

Example: `feat/dark-mode-toggle`

## Step 2: Create Worktree

Execute:
```bash
gw add <branch-name>
```

**Validation:**
- Command succeeded?
- Worktree appears in `gw list`?
- Files present in new directory?

If fails, see Error Recovery (Section 11).

## Step 3: Navigate to Worktree

```bash
gw cd <branch-name>
```

**Validation:**
- `pwd` shows correct directory?
- `.git` symlink points to correct location?

## Step 4: Install Dependencies

Check if dependencies need installation:
- Does `package.json` exist?
- Is post-add hook configured?

If manual install needed:
```bash
npm install
# or
pnpm install
# or
yarn install
```

**Validation:**
- `node_modules/` directory exists?
- Key dependencies present?
- No installation errors?

## Step 5: Verify Environment

Run basic checks:
```bash
# TypeScript project
npm run build  # or tsc --noEmit

# Linting
npm run lint

# Tests (quick smoke test)
npm test -- --listTests  # Just list, don't run yet
```

**Validation:**
- No immediate errors?
- Build system works?
- Test framework found?

## Step 6: Sync Configuration (If Needed)

If project uses autoCopyFiles:
```bash
gw sync <branch-name>
```

**Validation:**
- `.env` copied (if configured)?
- Other config files synced?
```

### Setup Checklist

- [ ] Branch name follows conventions
- [ ] Worktree created successfully
- [ ] Dependencies installed
- [ ] Environment builds/compiles
- [ ] Configuration files synced
- [ ] Ready to implement

---

## 5. Phase 3: Implementation

### Objectives

1. **Follow existing patterns** - Consistency with codebase
2. **Implement incrementally** - Small, focused changes
3. **Validate continuously** - Self-check at every step
4. **Commit logically** - Meaningful commit messages

### Procedure

```markdown
## Step 1: Start with Foundation

Implement in logical order:
1. Types/interfaces (if TypeScript)
2. Core logic/functions
3. UI components (if applicable)
4. Integration/glue code
5. Configuration updates

## Step 2: Implement One Change at a Time

For each file change:

### Before Editing:
- Read existing file completely
- Understand current structure
- Identify insertion points
- Note existing patterns

### During Editing:
- Make focused change (one concern)
- Follow existing code style
- Maintain consistent formatting
- Add comments only if logic non-obvious
- Don't over-engineer

### After Editing:
**Immediate validation:**
```bash
# Does it compile?
npm run build  # or tsc --noEmit

# Does it pass linting?
npm run lint -- <file-path>
```

**Self-review questions:**
- Does this match existing patterns?
- Is naming consistent with codebase?
- Are imports organized correctly?
- Did I introduce any obvious bugs?
- Is this the simplest solution?

### Iterate if needed:
- Validation failed? Fix immediately
- Code feels wrong? Refine before proceeding
- Don't accumulate technical debt

## Step 3: Commit Incrementally

After each logical unit of work:

```bash
git add <changed-files>
git commit -m "<type>(<scope>): <description>"
```

**Conventional commit format:**
- `feat(ui): add dark mode toggle button`
- `feat(theme): implement theme context provider`
- `test(theme): add theme toggle unit tests`
- `docs(readme): document dark mode feature`

**Commit guidelines:**
- One logical change per commit
- Clear, descriptive messages
- Reference issues if applicable
- Keep commits atomic (can be reverted independently)

## Step 4: Continuous Self-Validation

After every 2-3 files changed:

**Checkpoint validation:**
```bash
# Full build
npm run build

# All lint rules
npm run lint

# Quick test run (if fast)
npm test -- --coverage=false --maxWorkers=1
```

**Self-assessment:**
- Is implementation on track?
- Any deviations from plan?
- Need to adjust approach?

**Iteration decision:**
If validation reveals issues:
1. Stop and analyze root cause
2. Fix the underlying problem
3. Re-validate
4. Continue only when solid

## Step 5: Integration Check

After all implementation changes:

**Final integration validation:**
- All files compile together?
- No TypeScript/lint errors?
- Imports resolve correctly?
- No circular dependencies?

**Manual testing (if applicable):**
- Start dev server
- Test feature manually
- Try edge cases from Phase 0
- Verify user requirements met

## Step 6: Pre-Testing Commit

Commit all implementation work:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat(scope): implement <feature-name>

- Detail 1
- Detail 2
- Detail 3"
```

Now ready for formal testing (Phase 4).
```

### Implementation Checklist

- [ ] All planned files modified
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns
- [ ] Builds/compiles successfully
- [ ] Linting passes
- [ ] Commits are logical and clear
- [ ] Self-reviewed all changes
- [ ] Ready for testing

---

## 6. Phase 4: Testing & Iteration

### Objectives

1. **Run comprehensive tests** - Validate correctness
2. **Iterate aggressively** - Fix failures until passing
3. **Add new tests** - Cover new functionality
4. **Validate thoroughly** - Ensure quality

### Procedure

```markdown
## Step 1: Determine Test Strategy

Based on changes:

**Code changes require:**
- Unit tests for new functions/components
- Integration tests if multiple modules interact
- Regression tests for bug fixes

**UI changes require:**
- Component tests
- Visual regression tests (if available)
- Manual browser testing

**API changes require:**
- Endpoint tests
- Contract tests
- Error case coverage

## Step 2: Run Existing Tests

```bash
# Run full test suite
npm test

# Or specific tests if large codebase
npm test -- --testPathPattern="relevant"
```

**Expected outcomes:**
- ✅ All existing tests pass (no regressions)
- ❌ Some tests fail (expected if changing behavior)

## Step 3: Analyze Test Failures

For each failure:

### Understand the Failure:
- Read error message completely
- Identify which assertion failed
- Understand what was expected vs actual
- Trace back to root cause

### Categorize:
1. **Expected failure** - Behavior intentionally changed
   → Update test to match new behavior
2. **Regression** - Broke existing functionality
   → Fix implementation to preserve behavior
3. **Test infrastructure** - Test setup issue
   → Fix test configuration

### Prioritize:
- Critical failures first (core functionality)
- Edge cases later
- Flaky tests last (may be test issue)

## Step 4: Iterate Until Tests Pass

**Iteration loop (no hard limit):**

### Iteration 1:
1. Fix most obvious issues
2. Re-run tests
3. Validate: Did failures decrease?

### Iteration 2:
If still failing:
1. Re-analyze root cause (was first fix superficial?)
2. Try different approach
3. Re-run tests
4. Validate: Getting closer?

### Iteration 3+:
Keep iterating:
1. Consider alternative implementation
2. Review original plan (was approach wrong?)
3. Simplify if over-complicated
4. Ask: What would make tests pass?

**Continue until:**
- ✅ All tests passing, OR
- ⚠️ Identified blocker requiring user input

**Self-validation questions:**
- Are tests actually validating requirements?
- Are we testing the right things?
- Do tests cover edge cases from Phase 0?

## Step 5: Add New Tests (If Applicable)

If new functionality added:

```typescript
// Example: Testing new feature
describe('DarkModeToggle', () => {
  it('should toggle theme when clicked', () => {
    // Test new functionality
  });

  it('should persist preference to localStorage', () => {
    // Test persistence
  });

  it('should respect system preference on first load', () => {
    // Test edge case
  });
});
```

**New test requirements:**
- Cover main functionality
- Cover edge cases discussed in Phase 0
- Follow existing test patterns
- Use same testing utilities

**Validate new tests:**
```bash
# Run only new tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern="DarkModeToggle"
```

**Self-check:**
- Do new tests pass?
- Do they actually validate the feature?
- Are they maintainable?

## Step 6: Manual Validation (If Applicable)

For UI changes, use agent-browser:

```markdown
Objective: Validate dark mode toggle works correctly

Steps:
1. Start dev server (npm run dev)
2. Navigate to app (http://localhost:3000)
3. Locate dark mode toggle
4. Click toggle → verify theme changes
5. Refresh page → verify preference persisted
6. Test edge cases:
   - Different pages
   - Different components
   - System preference changes
```

## Step 7: Final Validation

All tests passing?

**Final checkpoint:**
```bash
# Clean test run
npm run test -- --coverage

# Check coverage (if requirements specified)
# Ensure new code has adequate coverage
```

**Self-assessment:**
- All requirements from Phase 0 validated?
- Edge cases tested?
- No regressions introduced?
- Tests are reliable (not flaky)?

## Step 8: Commit Test Changes

```bash
git add <test-files>
git commit -m "test(scope): add comprehensive tests for <feature>

- Unit tests for X
- Integration tests for Y
- Edge case coverage for Z"
```
```

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test strategy determined
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] Test failures analyzed and fixed
- [ ] New tests added (if applicable)
- [ ] Manual validation completed (if UI)
- [ ] Coverage adequate
- [ ] All requirements validated
- [ ] Ready for documentation

---

## 7. Phase 5: Documentation

### Objectives

1. **Identify documentation scope** - What needs updating
2. **Update relevant docs** - README, API docs, CHANGELOG
3. **Self-validate clarity** - Read as new user would
4. **Maintain style consistency** - Follow existing patterns

### Procedure

```markdown
## Step 1: Identify Documentation Needs

Based on changes:

**User-facing features:**
- README.md (usage examples)
- User guides
- Screenshots/demos

**API changes:**
- API documentation
- JSDoc/TSDoc comments
- OpenAPI/Swagger specs

**Configuration changes:**
- Config file documentation
- Environment variable docs
- Setup instructions

**Breaking changes:**
- CHANGELOG.md (highlight breaking changes)
- Migration guide

**All changes:**
- CHANGELOG.md entry

## Step 2: Update README (If Applicable)

Add usage examples:

```markdown
### Dark Mode

The app now supports dark mode! Toggle between light and dark themes:

#### Using the UI
Click the theme toggle in the navigation bar.

#### Programmatically
\```typescript
import { useTheme } from '@/contexts/ThemeContext';

function MyComponent() {
  const { theme, setTheme } = useTheme();

  // Toggle theme
  setTheme(theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light');
}
\```

#### Default Behavior
- Respects system preference on first load
- Persists user preference to localStorage
- Falls back to light mode if preference unavailable
```

**Validation:**
- Read example as new user
- Is it clear how to use the feature?
- Are code examples correct?
- Is it easy to find?

## Step 3: Update API Documentation (If Applicable)

Document new APIs:

```typescript
/**
 * Theme context providing theme state and controls.
 *
 * @example
 * \```tsx
 * import { useTheme } from '@/contexts/ThemeContext';
 *
 * function MyComponent() {
 *   const { theme, setTheme } = useTheme();
 *   return <button onClick={() => setTheme('dark')}>Dark Mode</button>;
 * }
 * \```
 */
export function useTheme(): ThemeContextValue {
  // ...
}
```

**Validation:**
- Are all public APIs documented?
- Are examples realistic?
- Is return type clear?

## Step 4: Update CHANGELOG

Add entry following project convention:

```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Dark mode toggle in navigation bar (#123)
  - Respects system preference
  - Persists user choice to localStorage
  - Applies theme globally

### Changed
- Theme context now exported from `@/contexts/ThemeContext`

### Fixed
- N/A
```

**Validation:**
- Entry describes user-facing changes?
- Includes relevant issue/PR numbers?
- Follows existing CHANGELOG format?

## Step 5: Update Other Documentation

Check for other docs needing updates:

- Configuration guides
- Architecture docs
- Team runbooks
- Troubleshooting guides

## Step 6: Self-Validation (Read as New User)

**Critical:** Read your own documentation with fresh eyes:

**Clarity check:**
- Can I understand this without context?
- Are examples self-contained?
- Is technical jargon explained?

**Completeness check:**
- Are all new features documented?
- Are edge cases explained?
- Are limitations mentioned?

**Accuracy check:**
- Do code examples actually work?
- Are paths/names correct?
- Is version info accurate?

**Iteration if needed:**
- Something confusing? Rewrite it
- Example unclear? Add more context
- Important detail missing? Add it

## Step 7: Commit Documentation

```bash
git add README.md CHANGELOG.md docs/
git commit -m "docs(feature): document dark mode toggle

- Add usage examples to README
- Update CHANGELOG with new feature
- Document theme context API"
```
```

## 9. Phase 7: Cleanup (Optional)

### When to Use This Phase

**Run cleanup when:**
- PR has been merged
- PR has been closed/abandoned
- User explicitly requests cleanup
- Need to reclaim disk space

**Do NOT cleanup if:**
- PR still under review
- User hasn't reviewed changes yet
- Might need to iterate on PR

### Procedure

```markdown
## Step 1: Check PR Status

```bash
gh pr view <pr-number> --json state,mergedAt
```

**Safe to cleanup if:**
- State: MERGED
- State: CLOSED (and user confirms)

**NOT safe if:**
- State: OPEN
- User hasn't reviewed yet

## Step 2: Confirm with User (If Uncertain)

"The PR for <feature> is <state>. Should I remove the worktree to clean up disk space?"

Wait for confirmation.

## Step 3: Remove Worktree

```bash
# Safe removal (ensures committed/pushed)
gw remove <branch-name>
```

**Validation:**
- Worktree removed from `gw list`?
- Directory deleted?
- Git administrative cleanup done?

## Step 4: Navigate to Main

```bash
gw cd main
```

**Validation:**
- In main worktree now?
- Can continue other work?

## Step 5: Report Cleanup

"✅ Worktree cleaned up. Disk space reclaimed: ~X MB"
```

### Cleanup Checklist

- [ ] PR status checked
- [ ] Safe to remove worktree
- [ ] Worktree removed successfully
- [ ] Navigated to main
- [ ] User notified

## 10. Decision Framework

### Branch Naming Decisions

**Decision tree:**

```
Is this a new feature?
├─ Yes → `feat/<feature-name>`
└─ No ↓

Is this fixing a bug?
├─ Yes → `fix/<bug-description>`
└─ No ↓

Is this refactoring existing code?
├─ Yes → `refactor/<scope>`
└─ No ↓

Is this documentation only?
├─ Yes → `docs/<doc-name>`
└─ No ↓

Is this testing only?
├─ Yes → `test/<test-scope>`
└─ No ↓

Is this tooling/dependencies?
└─ Yes → `chore/<tool-name>`
```

**Examples:**
- `feat/dark-mode-toggle`
- `fix/login-validation-error`
- `refactor/api-client-structure`
- `docs/api-reference-update`
- `test/user-service-coverage`
- `chore/upgrade-typescript-5`

### Test Strategy Selection

**Decision tree:**

```
What changed?

Pure functions/utilities?
→ Unit tests (Jest/Vitest)
→ Coverage target: >80%

React components?
→ Component tests (Testing Library)
→ Test: rendering, interactions, props

API endpoints?
→ Integration tests (supertest)
→ Test: request/response, errors

Database operations?
→ Integration tests with test DB
→ Test: CRUD, transactions, constraints

UI interactions?
→ E2E tests (Playwright/Cypress)
→ Test: user flows, critical paths

Multiple systems interacting?
→ Integration tests
→ Test: data flow, error propagation
```

### Documentation Scope Determination

**Decision tree:**

```
What's the change?

New user-facing feature?
├─ README: Usage example
├─ CHANGELOG: Feature entry
└─ User guide: Detailed walkthrough

New API/function?
├─ JSDoc/TSDoc: API documentation
├─ README: Quick example
└─ API reference: Full details

Configuration change?
├─ Config docs: New options
├─ README: Updated setup
└─ Migration guide (if breaking)

Bug fix?
├─ CHANGELOG: Fixed entry
└─ Tests: Regression coverage

Internal refactoring?
└─ CHANGELOG: Technical note (optional)
```

### Iteration vs Delivery Decision

**When to iterate:**

```
Tests failing?
└─ Iterate (fix and retest)

Feature incomplete?
└─ Iterate (finish implementation)

Requirements unclear after starting?
└─ STOP and ask user (return to Phase 0)

Code doesn't follow patterns?
└─ Iterate (refactor to match)

Documentation insufficient?
└─ Iterate (improve docs)
```

**When to deliver partial work:**

```
Blocker requires user input?
├─ Commit what's done
├─ Document blocker
├─ Create draft PR with notes
└─ Ask user for help

External dependency unavailable?
├─ Implement what's possible
├─ Document missing piece
└─ Deliver with action items

Fundamental approach wrong?
├─ Stop implementation
├─ Explain issue to user
└─ Request new direction
```

**Never stop for:**
- Test failures (iterate until passing)
- Lint errors (fix immediately)
- Unclear code (refactor until clear)
- Missing docs (write them)

## 11. Error Recovery Procedures

### Worktree Creation Failures

**Error:** `gw add` fails

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check git status
git status

# Check worktree list
git worktree list

# Check if branch already exists
git branch --list <branch-name>
```

**Recovery:**

```
Branch already exists?
├─ Use different branch name
└─ Or: Use existing branch (gw cd <branch>)

Permission error?
├─ Check directory permissions
└─ Try with sudo (if appropriate)

Disk space issue?
├─ Run: df -h
├─ Clean up: gw prune --clean
└─ Retry after space freed

Git error?
├─ Read error message carefully
├─ Fix underlying git issue
└─ Retry worktree creation
```

### Dependency Installation Failures

**Error:** `npm install` fails

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check node version
node --version

# Check package manager
which npm pnpm yarn

# Check network
ping registry.npmjs.org

# Read error output carefully
```

**Recovery:**

```
Network error?
├─ Check internet connection
├─ Try different registry
└─ Use cached dependencies

Version incompatibility?
├─ Check node version requirements
├─ Switch node version (nvm)
└─ Update package.json if needed

Lock file mismatch?
├─ Delete lock file
├─ Delete node_modules
└─ Reinstall fresh

Disk space?
├─ Clean npm cache: npm cache clean --force
└─ Free disk space
```

### Test Failures During Iteration

**Error:** Tests fail after implementation

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Run single failing test with verbose output
npm test -- --testPathPattern="failing-test" --verbose

# Check test coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Read stack trace completely
```

**Recovery approach:**

```markdown
## Iteration 1: Fix Obvious Issues
1. Read error message completely
2. Identify assertion that failed
3. Fix most likely cause
4. Rerun tests
5. Assess: Better or worse?

## Iteration 2: Deep Analysis
If still failing:
1. Add console.logs to understand state
2. Check assumptions about data/types
3. Verify mocks/stubs are correct
4. Fix root cause (not symptom)
5. Rerun tests

## Iteration 3: Alternative Approach
If still failing:
1. Question implementation approach
2. Review similar code in codebase
3. Consider simpler solution
4. Refactor if necessary
5. Rerun tests

## Iteration 4+: Systematic Debugging
1. Isolate minimal reproduction
2. Test each component independently
3. Verify test itself is correct
4. Consider test environment issues
5. Keep iterating until passing

## If Truly Stuck (rare):
1. Commit working code with failing test
2. Document exact failure and attempts
3. Ask user for guidance
```

**Never give up after fixed iterations** - iterate until tests pass or blocker identified.

### Merge Conflicts

**Error:** Merge conflict when pushing/rebasing

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check conflict files
git status

# View conflicts
git diff
```

**Recovery:**

```markdown
## Step 1: Understand Conflicts
- Read both versions (HEAD vs incoming)
- Understand intent of each change
- Determine correct resolution

## Step 2: Resolve Conflicts
```bash
# Open conflicted files
# Edit to resolve conflicts (remove markers)
# Keep both changes if both needed
# Choose one if mutually exclusive
```

## Step 3: Test After Resolution
```bash
# Ensure code still works
npm run build
npm test
```

## Step 4: Complete Resolution
```bash
git add <resolved-files>
git commit  # Or git rebase --continue
```

## Step 5: Validate
- All conflicts resolved?
- Tests still pass?
- Code makes sense?
```

### Build Failures

**Error:** `npm run build` fails

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Read build output completely
npm run build 2>&1 | tee build.log

# Check TypeScript errors
npx tsc --noEmit

# Check for missing files
```

**Recovery:**

```
TypeScript error?
├─ Fix type issues
├─ Add missing types
└─ Update imports

Missing dependency?
├─ Install missing package
└─ Update imports

Path/import error?
├─ Check file locations
├─ Fix import paths
└─ Verify tsconfig paths

Config error?
├─ Review build config
├─ Check recent changes
└─ Restore working config
```

## 12. Safety Guardrails

### Validation Checkpoints

**Phase 0:** Mandatory validation before any work
- ✓ Requirements understood
- ✓ User confirmed understanding

**Phase 1:** Plan validated before implementation
- ✓ Plan matches requirements
- ✓ Approach is sound

**Phase 2:** Environment validated before coding
- ✓ Worktree created
- ✓ Dependencies installed

**Phase 3:** Code validated during implementation
- ✓ Builds after each file
- ✓ Self-review before commit

**Phase 4:** Tests validated before delivery
- ✓ All tests pass
- ✓ Requirements verified

**Phase 5:** Documentation validated for clarity
- ✓ Read as new user
- ✓ Examples tested

**Phase 6:** Everything validated before PR
- ✓ All checks passing
- ✓ Complete and ready

### Rollback Procedures

**If need to undo work:**

```bash
# Undo uncommitted changes
git checkout .

# Undo last commit (keep changes)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Undo last commit (discard changes)
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Return to starting point
git reset --hard origin/main

# Remove worktree entirely
gw remove <branch-name> --force
```

### When to Stop and Ask

**Stop autonomous execution and ask user when:**

1. **Requirements ambiguous mid-implementation**
   - User's request wasn't clear enough
   - Edge case discovered not covered in Phase 0
   - Multiple valid approaches, unclear which to use

2. **Fundamental blocker encountered**
   - Required external service/API unavailable
   - Missing credentials/access
   - Architectural decision needed

3. **Scope creep detected**
   - Implementation expanding beyond original scope
   - Additional features seem necessary
   - Breaking changes not originally discussed

4. **Tests reveal misunderstanding**
   - Tests passing but not actually testing requirement
   - Requirements seem contradictory
   - Expected behavior unclear

5. **Resource/time limits approaching**
   - Already spent excessive time (>2 hours)
   - Many iterations without progress
   - Complexity greater than initially assessed

**How to ask:**

```markdown
"⚠️ Pausing autonomous execution - need guidance.

**Situation:**
[Describe what happened]

**Issue:**
[Explain the blocker/ambiguity]

**Options I see:**
1. [Option A] - [pros/cons]
2. [Option B] - [pros/cons]
3. [Option C] - [pros/cons]

**My recommendation:**
[Which option and why]

**Question:**
[Specific question for user]

Should I proceed with [recommended option] or would you prefer [alternative]?"
```

### Resource Limits

**Soft limits (guidelines, not hard stops):**

- **Commits:** ~3-10 per feature (logical grouping)
- **Files changed:** ~20 files max (if more, consider splitting)
- **Time:** ~1-2 hours (if longer, reassess approach)
- **Iterations:** No limit (iterate until correct)
- **Tests added:** Proportional to complexity

**Hard limits (stop and ask):**

- **>50 files changed** - Scope too large, split into multiple PRs
- **>3 hours stuck** - Fundamental issue, need user input
- **>100 commits** - Something wrong with approach
- **Breaking existing tests** - Don't disable tests, fix code or ask

### Quality Gates

**Before moving to next phase:**

- [ ] Previous phase checklist complete
- [ ] Self-validation passed
- [ ] No blocking errors
- [ ] Clear to proceed

**Before final delivery (Phase 6):**

- [ ] ALL tests passing
- [ ] Build succeeds
- [ ] Linting clean
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Self-reviewed all changes
- [ ] Requirements from Phase 0 met

**If any gate fails:**
1. Stop immediately
2. Identify root cause
3. Fix the issue
4. Re-validate
5. Only proceed when gate passes
