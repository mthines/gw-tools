## 1. Parallel Development Workflows

### Benefits of Parallel Development

Working on multiple branches simultaneously eliminates:
- Context switching overhead
- IDE reindexing delays
- Stashing/committing incomplete work
- Mental context loss

### Setting Up Multiple Worktrees

```bash
# Create worktrees for different features
gw add feat/user-auth
gw add feat/payment-gateway
gw add feat/email-notifications

# List all worktrees
gw list
```

### Managing Mental Context

**Strategy 1: Dedicated terminals**
```bash
# Terminal 1: User Auth
gw cd feat/user-auth
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Payment Gateway
gw cd feat/payment-gateway
npm run dev
```

**Strategy 2: Terminal multiplexer (tmux)**
```bash
# Create named sessions
tmux new -s auth
gw cd feat/user-auth

tmux new -s payments
gw cd feat/payment-gateway

# Switch between sessions
tmux attach -t auth
tmux attach -t payments
```

**Strategy 3: IDE workspaces**

VS Code multi-root workspace:
```json
{
  "folders": [
    {"name": "Auth Feature", "path": "../feat/user-auth"},
    {"name": "Payments", "path": "../feat/payment-gateway"}
  ]
}
```

### Quick Context Switching

```bash
# Fast navigation with partial matching
gw cd auth     # Matches feat/user-auth
gw cd pay      # Matches feat/payment-gateway
```

---

## 2. Dependency Management

### Understanding the Problem

Each worktree has independent working files, including `node_modules`:

```
repo.git/
├── main/
│   └── node_modules/     # ~500MB
├── feat/user-auth/
│   └── node_modules/     # ~500MB (duplicate!)
└── feat/payment-gateway/
    └── node_modules/     # ~500MB (duplicate!)
```

With 5 worktrees: **2.5GB** of duplicated dependencies!

### Strategy 1: Accept Duplication (Simplest)

**Pros:** Full isolation, no conflicts
**Cons:** Disk space usage

```bash
# Each worktree installs independently
gw add feat/new-feature
gw cd feat/new-feature
npm install
```

Best for: Testing different dependency versions, small projects.

### Strategy 2: Use pnpm (Recommended)

pnpm uses a content-addressable store that deduplicates packages:

```bash
# Install pnpm
npm install -g pnpm

# In each worktree
gw cd feat/user-auth
pnpm install  # Uses shared store

gw cd feat/payment-gateway
pnpm install  # Reuses cached packages
```

**Result:** Near-zero duplication, full isolation.

### Strategy 3: Symlink node_modules (Advanced)

**Warning:** Only works if all worktrees need identical dependencies.

```bash
# In feature worktree
gw cd feat/user-auth
rm -rf node_modules
ln -s ../main/node_modules node_modules
```

**Risks:**
- Package version conflicts
- Native modules may break
- Hoisting issues

Best for: Read-only testing, identical environments.

### Strategy 4: Post-Add Hook for Auto-Install

```bash
gw init --post-add "npm install"
```

Now every `gw add` automatically installs dependencies.

---

## 3. File Synchronization

### Using `gw sync`

Sync files between worktrees without recreating them:

```bash
# Sync all autoCopyFiles from config
gw sync feat/user-auth

# Sync specific file from main to feature branch
gw sync feat/user-auth .env

# Sync from specific source
gw sync --from staging feat/user-auth .env

# Sync multiple files
gw sync feat/user-auth .env secrets/ config/local.json
```

### Common Sync Patterns

**Pattern 1: Update secrets across all worktrees**

```bash
# After updating .env in main - sync autoCopyFiles to all worktrees
for worktree in $(gw list | grep -v main | awk '{print $1}' | xargs -n1 basename); do
  gw sync "$worktree"
done

# Or sync specific file
for worktree in $(gw list | grep -v main | awk '{print $1}' | xargs -n1 basename); do
  gw sync "$worktree" .env
done
```

**Pattern 2: Propagate config changes**

```bash
# Updated shared config in main
gw cd feat/user-auth
gw sync --from main feat/user-auth config/shared.json
```

**Pattern 3: Hot-swap environment**

```bash
# Test feature with production-like config
gw sync --from production-mirror feat/user-auth .env
```

### Dry Run Mode

Preview what would be synced:

```bash
gw sync --dry-run feat/user-auth .env secrets/
```

---

## 4. Database and Service Management

### Database Isolation Strategies

**Strategy 1: Separate databases per worktree**

```bash
# In feat/user-auth/.env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost:5432/myapp_auth

# In feat/payment-gateway/.env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost:5432/myapp_payments
```

**Strategy 2: Docker Compose per worktree**

Create `docker-compose.worktree.yml`:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:15
    ports:
      - "${DB_PORT:-5432}:5432"
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: myapp_${WORKTREE_NAME:-dev}
```

```bash
# In each worktree
export WORKTREE_NAME=$(basename $PWD)
export DB_PORT=5433  # Different port per worktree
docker-compose -f docker-compose.worktree.yml up -d
```

**Strategy 3: Shared database with schema prefixes**

```sql
-- feat/user-auth uses schema: auth_feature
CREATE SCHEMA auth_feature;

-- feat/payment-gateway uses schema: payments_feature
CREATE SCHEMA payments_feature;
```

### Port Management

Avoid port conflicts between worktrees:

```bash
# main/.env
PORT=3000
DB_PORT=5432

# feat/user-auth/.env
PORT=3001
DB_PORT=5433

# feat/payment-gateway/.env
PORT=3002
DB_PORT=5434
```

### Service Orchestration

Running frontend and backend in separate worktrees:

```bash
# Terminal 1: API (main branch)
gw cd main
npm run dev:api  # Port 3001

# Terminal 2: Frontend (feature branch)
gw cd feat/new-ui
API_URL=http://localhost:3001 npm run dev:web  # Port 3000
```

---

## 5. Testing Workflows

### Parallel Testing Across Environments

Test the same feature in multiple environments:

```bash
# Create test worktrees
gw add test-node18 --force
gw add test-node20 --force

# Terminal 1: Node 18
gw cd test-node18
nvm use 18
npm install && npm test

# Terminal 2: Node 20
gw cd test-node20
nvm use 20
npm install && npm test
```

### CI/CD Integration

**GitHub Actions with worktrees:**

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node: [18, 20, 22]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Node ${{ matrix.node }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm test
```

**Local simulation:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# test-matrix.sh
for version in 18 20 22; do
  gw add "test-node$version" --force
  (
    gw cd "test-node$version"
    nvm use "$version"
    npm install
    npm test
  ) &
done
wait
echo "All tests complete"
```

### Test Isolation

Each worktree can have different test configurations:

```bash
# In feat/user-auth
npm test -- --testPathPattern="auth"

# In feat/payment-gateway
npm test -- --testPathPattern="payment"
```

---

## 6. Build Artifact Management

### Separate Build Outputs

Each worktree maintains independent build artifacts:

```
repo.git/
├── main/
│   └── dist/        # Production build
├── feat/user-auth/
│   └── dist/        # Feature build
└── feat/payment-gateway/
    └── dist/        # Different feature build
```

### Sharing Build Caches

**Turborepo/Nx caching:**

```bash
# Turbo's cache is shared automatically
gw cd feat/user-auth
pnpm turbo build  # Fast: uses cache from main
```

**Manual cache sharing:**

```bash
# Share .next/cache between worktrees
ln -s ../main/.next/cache .next/cache
```

### Clean Build Strategies

When you need guaranteed clean builds:

```bash
# Remove build artifacts
rm -rf dist/ .next/ build/

# Fresh install and build
rm -rf node_modules/
npm install
npm run build
```

---

## 7. Team Collaboration

### Code Review Workflows

**Reviewer worktree pattern:**

```bash
# Create worktree from PR branch
gw add review-pr-123
gw cd review-pr-123

# Review code, run tests
npm install
npm test
npm run dev  # Manual testing

# Leave review comments
# ...

# Clean up
gw remove review-pr-123
```

### Pair Programming

**Each developer in their own worktree:**

```bash
# Developer A
gw add pair/feature-x-alice
gw cd pair/feature-x-alice
# Work on frontend...

# Developer B
gw add pair/feature-x-bob
gw cd pair/feature-x-bob
# Work on backend...

# Sync changes via git
git pull origin pair/feature-x
```

### Demo Environments

**One worktree per demo:**

```bash
# Create demo worktrees
gw add demo/client-a
gw add demo/client-b

# Each with different configuration
# demo/client-a/.env
FEATURE_FLAGS=clientA

# demo/client-b/.env
FEATURE_FLAGS=clientB
```

---

## 8. Performance and Optimization

### Monitoring Disk Usage

```bash
# Check worktree sizes
du -sh /path/to/repo.git/*/

# Find large node_modules
du -sh /path/to/repo.git/*/node_modules/ | sort -h
```

### Cleanup Strategies

**Quick cleanup:**

If you need to quickly remove all temporary worktrees:

```bash
# Preview what would be removed
gw prune --clean --dry-run

# Remove all worktrees that are clean (no uncommitted/unpushed changes)
gw prune --clean
```

This is useful when:
- Switching between projects
- Low on disk space
- Want to start fresh with minimal worktrees
- Before archiving a project

**Age-based cleanup (regular maintenance):**

```bash
# Remove worktrees older than configured threshold (default: 7 days)
gw clean --dry-run  # Preview
gw clean            # Remove
```

**Prune stale references:**

```bash
# Clean up administrative data for deleted worktrees
gw prune
```

### Resource Balancing

**Limit concurrent worktrees:**
- Development machine: 3-5 active worktrees
- CI machine: As many as needed (ephemeral)

**Memory considerations:**
- Each running dev server uses memory
- Each `node_modules` uses disk space
- Database containers use memory + disk

**Recommended setup:**
```bash
# Keep essential worktrees
main/           # Always ready
feat/current/   # Active feature
review/         # Code review (temporary)
hotfix/         # Emergency fixes (temporary)
```

### When NOT to Use Multiple Worktrees

Consider alternatives when:
- Single small fix → Just commit and switch back
- Same file being edited → Use branches instead
- Limited disk space → Use branch switching
- Team uses different workflow → Align first
